    <h1>wind turbine</h1>
    <p>A wind turbine is a device that converts the kinetic energy of wind into electrical energy. As of 2020, hundreds of <br> 
        thousands of large turbines, in installations known as wind farms, were generating over 650 gigawatts of power, <br> 
        with 60 GW added each year.[1] Wind turbines are an increasingly important source of intermittent renewable <br> 
        energy, and are used in many countries to lower energy costs and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. One study <br> 
        claimed that, as of 2009, wind had the "lowest relative greenhouse gas emissions, the least water consumption <br>
         demands and the most favorable social impacts" compared to photovoltaic, hydro, geothermal, coal and gas <br>
          energy sources</p>
   
          <p>Smaller wind turbines are used for applications such as battery charging and remote devices such as traffic <br>
             warning signs. Larger turbines can contribute to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the <br>
              utility supplier via the electrical grid.[3]</p>
        
            <p>Wind turbines are manufactured in a wide range of sizes, with either horizontal <br>
                 or vertical axes, though horizontal is most common.[4]</p>

                 <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>The windwheel of Hero of Alexandria (10–70 CE) marks one of the first recorded instances of wind <br>
                         powering a machine.[5] However, the first known practical wind power plants were built in Sistan, an Eastern <br>
                          province of Persia (now Iran), from the 7th century. These "Panemone" were vertical axle windmills, which <br>
                           had long vertical drive shafts with rectangular blades.[6] Made of six to twelve sails covered in reed matting <br>
                            or cloth material, these windmills were used to grind grain or draw up water, and were used in the <br> 
                            gristmilling and sugarcane industries.[7]</p>

                        <p>Wind power first appeared in Europe during the Middle Ages. The first historical records of their use in <br> 
                            England date to the 11th and 12th centuries; there are reports of German crusaders taking their windmill-making<br>
                             skills to Syria around 1190.[8] By the 14th century, Dutch windmills were in use to drain areas of the <br>
                              Rhine delta. Advanced wind turbines were described by Croatian inventor Fausto Veranzio in his book <br>
                               "Machinae Novae" (1595), he described vertical axis wind turbines with curved or V-shaped blades.</p>

                            <p>The first electricity-generating wind turbine was installed by the Austrian Josef Friedländer at the Vienna <br>
                                 International Electrical Exhibition in 1883. It was a Halladay windmill for driving a dynamo. Friedländer’s 22-foot <br>
                                  (6.6-meters) diameter Halladay “wind motor” was supplied by U.S. Wind Engine & Pump Co. of Batavia, Illinois. <br>
                                   The five horsepower windmill drove a dynamo at ground level that fed electricity into a series of batteries. The <br>
                                    batteries powered various electrical tools and lamps, as well as a threshing machine. Friedländer’s windmill and its <br>
                                     accessories were prominently installed at the north entrance to the main exhibition hall ("Rotunde") in the Vienna <br> 
                                     Prater.</p>
