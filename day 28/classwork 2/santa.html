            <h1>WHO IS SANTA?</h1>
            <p>Santa Claus, also known as Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, Saint Nick, Kris Kringle, or simply Santa, is a legendary figure
                <br> originating in Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts during the late evening and overnight hours on Christmas 
                <br> Eve. He is said to accomplish this with the aid of Christmas elves, who make the toys in his North Pole workshop, and with 
                <br> the aid of flying reindeer who pull his sleigh through the air.
                <br>
                <br>
                The modern figure of Santa is based on folklore traditions surrounding Saint Nicholas, the English figure of Father Christmas, 
                <br> the German Belsnickel and the Dutch figure of Sinterklaas.
                <br>
                <br>
                Santa is generally depicted as a portly, jolly, white-bearded man, often with spectacles, wearing a red coat with white fur collar 
                <br> and cuffs, white-fur-cuffed red trousers, a red hat trimmed with white fur, a black leather belt and boots, carrying a bag 
                <br> full of gifts for children. He is popularly associated with a deep, hearty laugh, frequently rendered in Christmas literature 
                <br> as "ho, ho, ho!"
